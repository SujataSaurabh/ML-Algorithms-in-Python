# ML-Algorithms-in-Python

This repository contains implementation code for basic machine learning algorithms in Python. The primary goal is to provide clear, beginner-friendly examples of core ML techniques using Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook explains the intuition, workings, and practical application of different algorithms.

## Purpose

- **Educational Resource:** Learn the fundamental concepts of machine learning by studying and running real code.
- **Reference Implementations:** Use simple, readable Python examples as a starting point for your own projects or studies.
- **Experimentation:** Modify the notebooks to see how changes affect results and deepen your understanding.

## Contents

- **Supervised Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, etc.
- **Unsupervised Algorithms:** k-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.
- **Additional Concepts:** Data preprocessing, model evaluation, visualization techniques.

Each algorithm is presented in its own Jupyter Notebook with explanations, code, and sample outputs.

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SujataSaurabh/ML-Algorithms-in-Python.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install Jupyter Notebook and required libraries (like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib):
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
     ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open the desired notebook from the repository.

4. **Run cells:** Step through each cell to execute the code and view results. You can modify parameters or data to experiment.
